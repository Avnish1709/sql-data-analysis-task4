# 📊 SQL for Data Analysis – Task 4

## 🧠 Objective

The goal of this task is to use SQL to analyze data from a structured ecommerce dataset. This involves writing queries using various SQL clauses and techniques like JOINs, aggregate functions, subqueries, and views.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- 🛠 **SQLite** (via [sqliteonline.com](https://sqliteonline.com))
- 💻 Notepad (for writing and saving `.sql` file)
- 🖼 Screenshot Tool (for capturing query outputs)
- 🌐 GitHub (for submission)

---


## 🔍 SQL Concepts Used

- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`
- `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`)
- `JOIN` (Inner)
- `Subqueries`
- `Views` (and fallback logic if not supported)
- `IFNULL()` for null handling

## 📜 Queries Executed

1. Orders with amount > ₹2000  
2. Total sales by each customer  
3. Customer name with order details (JOIN)  
4. Average order value  
5. Customers who ordered > ₹3000 (Subquery)  
6. Sales summary view  
7. Null value handling

👉 All queries are saved in: `task4_queries.sql`
